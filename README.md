# Hello, there! <img width=30 src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif'>

<p> I am a full stack software engineer who is passionate about utilizing the newest technologies to further push the boundaries of what is possible. I originally graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry which was fueled by my curiosity to understand just how the human body works. I tend to joke that developing a full stack application is very similiar to the human body. The HTML/CSS is what is seen as the physical appearance, the server represents all the organs, muscle, and tissue inside the body, and the database connects it all through the brain. </p>
